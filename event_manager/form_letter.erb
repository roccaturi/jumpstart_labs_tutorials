  		<p>Thanks for coming to our conference.  We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

  		<p>Political activism is at the heart of any democracy and your voice needs to be heard.
		Please consider reaching out to your following representatives:
  		</p>

  		<table>
		<tr><th>Name</th><th>Website</th></tr>
		<% legislators.each do |legislator| %>
		<tr>
		<td><%= "#{legislator.first_name}, #{legislator.last_name}" %></td>
		<td><%= "#{legislator.website}" %></td>
		</tr>
		<% end %>
		</table>
		<p><%= if phone.nil?
		       "We'd also like to invite to register online for our Mobile Alerts Program."
		       else "Per your request, we've added #{phone[0..2]}-#{phone[3..5]}-#{phone[6..9]} to our Mobile Alerts Program."
		       end %></p>
		<p>You will be able to keep up-to-date on future events without any additional effort.  It is our 
		  policy to only use your phone number for the most vital communications, and we will never provide 
		  your contact information to a third-party without consent.  Remember, if you should wish to opt-out 
		  of the rogram at anytime, you can easily update your account from the conference website.</p>
